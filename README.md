Blog site created for a local small business who sells crafts online, mostly through social media and shopify.  Wanted to create a blog to help other small business owners with the struggles of finding a client base and useful resources that they have found.

Blog site created using an html template that I had to markup with php to get it to work with wordpress.

## Optimizations
Would like to spend more time learning the inner workings of wordpress and offer more custimization for the client.  

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first experience with PHP and Wordpress.  Learned a lot about the process of creating a custom template that can work with wordpress' UI.  Really liked learning how to make paralax scrolling work with JS.
